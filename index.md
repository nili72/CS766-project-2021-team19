# Synthetic CT generation from PET images for attenuation correction with Deep Learning methods
CS766 2022 Spring project
Xue Li, Ni Li

## Introduction and Motivation 

Positron emission tomography (PET) and positron emission mammography (PEM) using 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG) have been shown to have high specificity for breast cancer detection.
However, breast-specific PET is not routinely utilized; instead, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used clinically for extent of disease evaluation and neoadjuvant therapy response assessment for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. The recent availability of simultaneous PET/MR scanners offers the benefit of combining the high sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer provided by contrast-enhanced MR imaging with functional imaging using PET.
However, there are two problems for MR images generated by clinical PET/MR system, the missing bone information and back truncation problem as shown in Fig 1. The former one is due to the technical challenges of obtaining positive MR signal in bone in clinical PET/MR system while the latter one is caused by position patient are placed during imaging to get better breast images. Both of two problems will lead to errors during breast cancer treatment, which is not desired. In current pipeline, MR images are used to generate synthetic CT (sCT) images for later attenuation correction of PET images. Therefore, the missing bone and back truncation problems
will happen to sCT as well. As a result, inaccurate attenuation correction of PET images is calculated, and there is up to 20% error for the final treatment plan.

In the video, you can see one of the environments that we used in the gym-miniworld.


__Why is this important?__

We are looking into a future where a robot might be used to solve some challenging and difficult task without apriori knowledge about the environment. 
Very briefly explained SLAM has three important features: pose estimation, mapping in real-time and efficiently and planning where to go next.
For the RL we have an agent that chooses actions and the environment to interact with. 
In this project we used a minimalist 3D RL environment with navigation based reward. 
The idea behind the solution is the assumption that SLAM will localize more efficiently than a DQN. 
However, one downside is the complexity of implementation for SLAM that slows it down.

## Background

### ORB-SLAM2

<p align="center">

</p>

It is important to note that all of the ORB-SLAM algorithms use bundle adjustment(BA) to provide estimates of camera localization and sparse geometric reconstruction. 
Due to the lack of depth, we won’t be describing BA in detail.
The tracking is the first step and it works by localizing the camera with every frame and deciding when to insert a new frame. 
The local mapping processes new keyframes and performs local BA. 
In this steep during tracking, culling of the points is applied to keep the high-quality points. 
The loop closing searches for the loops with every new keyframe. 
In the original ORB-SLAM, the final step is a pose graph optimization over similarity constraints to achieve global consistency. 
The final step of the loop closing when building a map, ORB-SLAM was built on the Essential Graph feature, which remains a part of the algorithm in all future versions. 
The system builds a spanning tree from the initial keyframe, and each time a new keyframe is inserted, it is included in the tree linked to the keyframe that shares most point observations. 
In a case when a keyframe is erased by culling, the system updates all the affected keyframesbags of words(BoW) place recognition module that performs loop detection and relocalization

## Approach

In order to evaluate the relative performance of reinforcement learning with and without the inclusion of SLAM-derived features, 
we initially trained an agent to complete a modified version of the MiniWorld-Hallway-v0 environment.

- Environment setting:
- Simulation environment: gym-miniworld
- SLAM library: 
  - pySLAM
  - ORB-SLAM2 + python bindings
  - ORB-SLAM3 (did not work well)
- Reinforcement learning library : Stable Baselines

### ORB-SLAM2

It's worth mentioning that most SLAM library are designed for ROS and C++ platform, such as orb-SLAM2 and lsd-SLAM, therefore we spent great effort in letting SLAM running on a python simulation environment without ROS.

- Modify step() function where each step action is defined in gym-miniworld so that it will call orb-slam2 directly
- Modify the python-binding for processMono() so that it will directly output 4x4 homogenous transformation matrix which contain position and orientation.
- Interpolate each action into 10 frames and feed into SLAM
- Camera calibration:
   - OpenGL has some different way of defining the projection matrix and use angle of view to represent intrinsic camera information.
- Focal length:
- Alpha = 2 arctan(d/2f)

    where d is the dimension of image, alpha is the angle of view, f is the focus length.
- Principal points: 
   - camera set by gluperspective() function requires zero principle when map into normalized device coordinates(NDC), but since we export the rendering and fed that into SLAM as a OpenCV image, the principal points then becomes the center of image

</p>

### PySLAM

In addition to Orb-SLAM 2, we used a modified version of pyslam to extract position and orientation. 
We reconfigured pyslam to accept an image as an argument and return the position and orientation quaternion. 
Pyslam also provides a monocular SLAM implementation, so it forms its localization and mapping estimates from a sequence of single-camera RGB images

### ORB-SLAM3

ORB-SLAM3 is the latest in the ORB-SLAM libraries. 
There was a possibility that certain disadvantages of the other two libraries, like speed, and sudden map disruptions,
would be resolved with ORB-SLAM3. 
After multiple attempts to make this work, and trying to modify some of the python bindings,
we were unable to implement this approach. 

However, we did do some background research how this library would work, so we provide a brief summary of some novelties and advantages.

Atlas is a multi-map representation composed of a set of disconnected maps.  
The tracking threadtakes input from the correct frame with respect to the active map in Atlas in real-time, 
and it decided whether the currentframe  becomes  a  keyframe.   
If  tracking  is  lost,  the  thread  tries  to  relocate  the  current  thread.   
Depending  on  that,  it decides whether the tracking is resumed, switching the active map if needed, 
or whether or not the active map is storedas non-active,  and a new map is initiated as an active map.  
The next component is a local mapping thread that adds keyframes and points to the active map, removes the redundant ones, 
and refines the map using visual or visual-inertialbundle adjustment. 
Also, in the inertial case, the IMU parameters are initialized and refined by the mapping thread usingthe MAP-estimation technique.  
The last component is the loop and map merging thread that detects common regions between the active map and the whole Atlas at keyframe rate.  
The way this works is that the system checks whetherthe common area belongs to the active map.  
The system then performs loop correction; if it belongs to a different map,both maps are seamlessly merged into a single one, 
and this becomes a new active map.  
Finally, a full BA runs as anindependent thread to prevent anything affecting a real-time map performance.

## Results

### ORB-SLAM2

Here is a demo video that pytorch is trying the agent with SLAM results in real-time.

Timing issue:

| Settings                       | Time per action | 
|:-------------------------------|:----------------|
| 10frames/action​ With viewer    | 0.34s           | 
| 10frames/action​ Without viewer | 0.33s           | 
| 20frames/action                | 0.67s           |
| 5frames/action                 | 0.17s           | 


Resolution: 800x600

Problems to be solved:​

1) speed, SLAM module will slow down the training speed​

2) unexpected loop-closure & lost track: richness of texture inside simulation environment


### PySLAM

We created a set of 200 reference images using our agent trained through standard DQN in modified MiniWorld-Hallway-v0 environment. 
We analyzed the time it took to perform SLAM on this sequence of images in pyslam


## Future work

1) Encode the slam results into DQN model input

2) Improve the code performance to get faster performance

3) Find appropriate parameters that mitigate the "lost of track" issue
